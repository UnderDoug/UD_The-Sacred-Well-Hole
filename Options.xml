      When enabled, debug entries will be sent to the Message Queue any time (with few exceptions) they would be sent to Player.log.
      At higher levels of verbosity, this can be {{r|very}} "loud" and spammy.

      Creatures have a 15% chance, under most circumstances, to spawn with Wrassle Equipment if they spawn with {{gigantic|Gigantism}} ({{r|D}}).
      The player has a much smaller chance due to it being a full set of gear and a weapon. When enabled, this option presents a slider to manually select the chance that player characters will spawn with their own unique set.

      The default is {{w|Disabled}}.
